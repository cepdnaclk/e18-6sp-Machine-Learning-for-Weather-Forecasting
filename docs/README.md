## Introduction

 Machine learning for climate forecasting addresses the pressing real-world problem of accurately predicting and understanding climate patterns. Climate change has severe consequences on ecosystems, agriculture, and human lives. By harnessing the power of machine learning algorithms, this project aims to enhance climate models, enabling more precise and reliable forecasts. The impact is significant as it assists policymakers, researchers, and communities in making informed decisions related to disaster management, agriculture, energy, and urban planning. Improved climate forecasting can aid in mitigating the effects of climate change, minimizing risks, and promoting sustainable development, ultimately fostering a resilient and adaptive society.
